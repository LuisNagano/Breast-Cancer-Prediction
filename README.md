# Advanced Project: Breast Cancer Prediction

## Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for improving the survival rates and treatment outcomes for breast cancer patients. This project aims to build and evaluate various machine learning models to predict breast cancer using clinical and pathological data.

## Business Problem

Early detection of breast cancer can significantly improve the prognosis and treatment success. This project leverages machine learning techniques to build predictive models that can help in diagnosing breast cancer at an early stage, potentially saving lives and reducing treatment costs.

## Business Assumptions

- The dataset is representative of the population.
- The features provided are sufficient to build accurate predictive models.
- There are no significant biases in the data.

## Solution Strategy

1. **Data Description**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution and relationships between features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features based on domain knowledge and initial data exploration.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for modeling.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed analysis to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.
5. **Model Building**: Training various machine learning models.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
7. **Model Deployment**: Preparing the best model for deployment.

## Data Description

- **Dataset**: The breast cancer dataset includes clinical and pathological data for breast cancer diagnosis.
- **Features**: Includes attributes like mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
- **Target Variable**: Diagnosis (M for malignant, B for benign).

## Feature Engineering

- **Hypothesis Creation**: Based on domain knowledge, hypotheses were created to test various relationships between features and the target variable.
- **New Features**: Derived features that could potentially improve model performance.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Loading the Data**:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv('data/breast_cancer.csv')
    ```

2. **Handling Missing Values**:
    ```python
    df.isnull().sum()
    ```
    - There were no missing values in the dataset.

3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**:
    ```python
    df['diagnosis'] = df['diagnosis'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'M' else 0)
    ```

4. **Scaling Features**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X = df.drop('diagnosis', axis=1)
    y = df['diagnosis']
    X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
    ```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Univariate Analysis**:
  Density plots and histograms were used to visualize the distribution of each feature.
  
- **Bivariate Analysis**:
  Boxplots and scatter plots were used to examine the relationships between features and the diagnosis.

- **Multivariate Analysis**:
  Heatmaps were used to visualize correlations between multiple features.

## Model Building

Various models were trained and evaluated on the dataset. Below are the implementation details for each model:

1. **Logistic Regression**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    log_reg = LogisticRegression()
    log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier()
    knn.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    svc = SVC(probability=True)
    svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

4. **Decision Tree Classifier**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    dtc = DecisionTreeClassifier()
    dtc.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

5. **Random Forest Classifier**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    rand_clf = RandomForestClassifier()
    rand_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

6. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**:
    ```python
    from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier
    gbc = GradientBoostingClassifier()
    gbc.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

7. **XGBoost Classifier**:
    ```python
    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    xgb = XGBClassifier()
    xgb.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```

## Model Deployment

The best-performing models were saved using the `pickle` module for future deployment. The saved models can be loaded and used to make predictions on new data.

```python
import pickle

# Save the model
with open('svc_model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(svc, file)

# Load the model
with open('svc_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    loaded_model = pickle.load(file)
```
